# Exposure to Tobacco Content on Social and Tobacco Use: A Meta-Analysis

## Code written by [Scott Donaldson, PhD](https://github.com/SDonaldsonUSC) 
This study examined whether there is an association between exposure to tobacco content on social media and tobacco use. The code was developed using the book [“Doing Meta-Analysis with R: A Hands-On Guide”](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/) 

### Data Preparation and Analysis
1. AuthorData contains the raw data that authors provided to compute statistics if they were not included in the published manuscript
2. RawEffectSize_Calculations/MetaAnalysis.xlsx contains the raw data used to compute effect sizes based on the [Practical Meta-Analysis Effect Size Calculator](https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/escalc/html/EffectSizeCalculator-Home.php)
3. Code/MetaAnalysis.Rmd contains the replicable code used to perform the meta-analysis and related analyses
